The Molecule Store sells science and chemistry inspired jewelry, apparel & accessories.  
Two main concepts are guiding the project Molecule Store:

1. 99% of what we sell is made on demand in the US and Europe. This way we can reduce waste and shipping distances to a minimum.
2. Shop nerdy and do good. We donate 1 USD for each product ordered to science education. We have so far collected over 6.000 USD.
