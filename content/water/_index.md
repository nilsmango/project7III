## FAQ

### Is 7III Water a subscription-based app?
No. 7III Water uses a one-time payment to unlock premium features. No subscriptions, no recurring fees.

### Which water sports can I track with 7III Water?
You can track downwind foiling, pump foiling, wake thief, wing foil, kite foil, SUP, surfing and many more water sports.

### Does 7III Water work with Apple Watch and Garmin?
Yes. The app works on iPhone and Apple Watch, and supports GPX import from Garmin and other smartwatches.

### Is my data stored in the cloud?
No. Your session and workout data stay on your device (stored in Apple Health, so you won't lose your data if you switch the app). You don't need an account.

### Is 7III Water only for downwind foiling?
No. While it's built with downwind foiling and wake thieving in mind, it's a full-featured water sports tracker for many disciplines.

### How do you pronounce 7III Water?
**7III Water** /sĕv′ən thrē wô′tər, wŏt′ər/

**noun**  
The 7III comes from **project7III**, which is *project*, *seven* followed by *three i's*. Spoken out loud, that becomes *project seven three*.  
We turned 73 into a modern text logo, very 21st century, and admittedly to confuse people along the way.
