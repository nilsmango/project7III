## Live Set with Tap on an iPhone
This was real-world R&D at 10,000 meters. [Nils Mango](https://nilsmango.ch) brought Tap onto an airplane to see how far true portability could go; and it delivered. Tap controlled Ableton Live running on an iPhone with zero issues, turning a cramped airplane seat into a miniature live-performance setup.  
The experiment proved that Tap is the the most portable Ableton controller ever made. The live set worked, the workflow was smooth, and with a bit more practice and preparation, the next in-air performance will be even better.
