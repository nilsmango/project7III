Tap is a modern Ableton Live controller designed for both **iPhone and iPad**.  
Whether you're launching clips, shaping sounds, sequencing drums or tweaking devices, Tap gives you a fast, clean and beautifully responsive interface in a small form factor.

## Why an Ableton Live Controller App?
Why turn two knobs when you have ten fingers and could tweak up to 8 macros at a time and still have two fingers left for mixing? Hardware controllers have their charm, but at project7III we focus on the future. A touchscreen is simply the most flexible and precise tool for adjusting parameters, launching clips, sequencing, and mixing.  
That's why we created Tap: the most performance-dense Ableton Live controller in the world. If you have a few bucks to spare and an iOS device, you're ready to upgrade your workflow.  
  
Here are some of the reasons why you should consider Tap:
- **Works on both iPhone and iPad**  
- **Plug-and-play** with Ableton Live via USB (Mac) or WiFi (Mac & Windows)
- **Beautiful, clean interface** designed for performance
- **Three powerful views**: Device, Clips, Mixer
- **Awesome MIDI sequencers, keyboards and pads**
- **Universal MIDI CC mode** for controlling any instrument or app
- **Adaptive layouts** for portrait and landscape on iPad

### Device View
- Different MIDI keyboards & pads  
- Drum and melodic step sequencer  
- Devices & banks  
- 8 encoders per bank
- Modulation tools and powerful note editing  

Designed for quick sound design, live modulation, and fast sequencing.

### Clips View
- Launch, record, append, copy & duplicate clips  
- Trigger and duplicate scenes  
- Access devices without switching to another screen  
- Designed for fast performance workflows 

### Mixer View
- Volume, sends, pan, solo, and mute layout  
- Integrated clips panel

- **USB** (macOS)
- **WiFi** (macOS & Windows)

        Ich bin jetzt echt baff. TAP ist irgendwie total großartig durchdacht und nutzt die capture MIDI Funktion von Ableton Live gnadenlos gut aus… weiter bin ich noch nicht aber random drums, synths und effekte laden ist sowas von Jam Like! Fantastisch, was kommt denn da noch von Entwickler? Ich hoffe das ist nur der Anfang. 7.99€ Lächerlich, Kauft Leute, jeden Cent wert!

        Was pleasantly surprised how well this has been laid out and works. Gives loads of control. I actually stopped using my Push 2 for now as 7III TAP inspires more. This is what Touchable Pro should have been. For the price a no brainer. Go get!

        Un buen y económico recurso para producir y para usar en performances en vivo. Lo usé en Windows con el iPad y luego de la configuración inicial, funcionó sin problemas. Recomendado.

        Tap works so well with Ableton it feels like it was made as an official app. The design language matches Ableton so it's easy to get started quickly compared to other apps. I had a question and the owner replied to me in less than a day, which I think is amazing. I will update if I find any issues but this is a 5 star app for me!

        This app literally changed my life in Live. It's super stable and fluid. Super useful for live session, mixing and creative process. It works very well for controlling your midi instrument and writing automations. That's all you need to give much more live feeling to your tracks. 100% worth it 👌
